JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

I have done a few similar repos in the past. This one is just the latest for me to use and point others to. 

In this repo I am taking a TDD approach using node's assert inline for UTs and a combination perf/integration test module for each logical grouping. (**Moving to node-tap as of 4/6/20)
